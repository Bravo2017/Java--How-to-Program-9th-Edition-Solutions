This is a collection of solutions for various problems in the 9th edition of "Java How to Program".

Note: They might not be exact solutions (they may not use the exact method required), and most of them will be much more advanced than the book expects.

Some might also contain multiple solutions.  Some of the additional solutions may be there just because I thought it would be fun to make it more complex (like adding networking to a HelloWorld type thing).
